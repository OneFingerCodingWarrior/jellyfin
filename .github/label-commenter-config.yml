          This pull request has been tagged as a stable backport. It will be cherry-picked into the next stable point release.

          Please observe the following:

            * Any dependent PRs that this PR requires **must** be tagged for stable backporting as well.

            * Any issue(s) this PR fixes or closes **should** target the current stable release or a previous stable release to which a fix has not yet entered the current stable release.
          
            * This PR **must** be test cherry-picked against the current release branch (`release-X.Y.z` where X and Y are numbers). It must apply cleanly, or a diff of the expected change must be provided.
              
              To do this, run the following commands from your local copy of the Jellyfin repository:
              
                1. `git checkout master`

                1. `git merge --no-ff <myPullRequestBranch>`

                1. `git log` -> `commit xxxxxxxxx`, grab hash

                1. `git checkout release-X.Y.z` replacing X and Y with the *current* stable version (e.g. `release-10.7.z`)

                1. `git cherry-pick -sx -m1 <hash>`

              Ensure the `cherry-pick` applies cleanly. If it does not, fix any merge conflicts *preserving as much of the original code as possible*, and make note of the resulting diff.

              Test your changes with a build to ensure they are successful. If not, adjust the diff accordingly.

              **Do not** push your merges to either branch. Use `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to revert both branches to their original state.

              Reply to this PR with a comment beginning "Cherry-pick test completed." and including the merge-conflict-fixing diff(s) if applicable.
